# Instructions

Take your completed Exercise 1 App and expand it by adding the following:

1. Create a second View which is similar to the first View from Exercise 1.
    1. It will display a single line of text.
    1. The background color is a color of your choice other than the default '#fff', and is different from the color you used on your first View.
1. Set this string to display "Thanks for using my app!".
1. Add a Tab Navigator with the bar on the bottom of both Views.
1. When the tabs are tapped, the App should switch between the two Views.
    1. As in, there is a tab for View 1 which when pressed switches to View 1 if you're not already on it.
    1. And there is a second tab for View 2 which will switch to that View if you're not already on it.
1. Record a video of your app running in either the Android Emulator or the iOS Simulator.
    1. Your video must show you tapping the tab on View 1 and the App then switching to View 2.
    1. It should then show you tapping the tab on View 2 and the App switching to View 1.
1. Put your video in the folder with your App, and zip the entire folder.
1. Submit this zip folder here in Canvas.
